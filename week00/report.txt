#Naomi_Riana_Lumban_Gaol

In task week00, we learned about the introduction of operating system and using linux bash for the first time.

Linux bash can be accessed using Windows 10 or badak.cs.ui.ac.id.
We had to install putty to accessed into kawung.cs.ui.ac.id and then login to badak.cs.ui.ac.id.
We also had to make our github account to create our own repository so we can save or submit our progress.

In week00, we learned about the introduction of operating system.

Computer system consists of hardware, operating system, application programs, and users.
Operating system (OS) is intermediary between user and computer hardware.
Operating system is interrupt-driven. The interrupts are polling-type and vectored interrupt system-type.
Storage-device hierarchy (from top to bottom) :
registers -> cache -> main memory -> solid-state disk -> hard disk -> optical disk -> magnetic tapes

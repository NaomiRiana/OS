Why we need to study OS?
Because OS is fundamental base of everything (related to computer system).
 
Operating Systems are necessary so the users can access programs via any hardware device.
Currently computer becomes more simple (for users) but more complex (for developer, because generally they want to make users being
comfortable).
With studying OS, we'll be able to understand how OS works, the benefits or the flaws of it,
with hope that in the future, people can applicate the lesson from OS such as 
upgrading the recently available OS (Windows/Linux) into better version or even, making the new, better OS.
